                    The whole story of Freddy Fazbear's family diner came from the founder Willam.V.Afton and the co-founder Henry Emily.  
                    This all started from 1930's from Willam being a young child wanting to continu the family business[this is being used very loosly becausa none for the fnaf theorist know]
                    In 30's there was the gret depreshion, Uath being 4th highst unemmployment in the nation. As poeple where leaving Uhta to seek work in California.
                    As poeple where treviling there was one thing that could lift there spirats a simpal side show attreshon called " The Wanderful... FredBear's singing show!" there was a bunch of adds plesterd every where.
                    Featuring an animated bear in a clessic pie crust eye artstly, he represented chericters like mickey mouse,felix the cat, betty boop and many more. FredBears was a place where you could bring the family.
                    The prices was honestly priced for 50c you could get food and drinks as you watch the local rial life traind dancing bear. Normaly you would only see bears in cercuses. The ticks are 1.00$ a 1.004 with out food.
                    But FredBears  was a smaller show where the ticks are mear 50c. This show left a mear impreshion on one little boy named Billy [it's Willam.V.Afton billy is his nick name from his mother]. For years Willam has dreamd of making a show like FazBear.
                    Willam Afton got inspierd by Disney [ back in the 30s disney was uing 5 finger maescons be for the head costums with limpy harms on the sides].Finally with a simpal mascot on willams saids he would finally have his child hood dream came true.
                    He would be able to being Freddy to life. To make fredGear more appinging to kids (and copy right resoning) he changed freddy from a relistic brown animal to a yellow bear with a purpal hat and bow tie. Willam gave FredBearsa conpanion a yellow rabbit with a purpal vest and purpal bow tie called SpringBonnie.
                    FredBear was speshial but Speing bonnie was extra speshial. SpringBonnie was willam's origanal chericter, he mwad bonnie all from screch. Willam littery mead spring bonnie from screch, you can see the stichinf mead on the siut it's a head crufted suit. you can see the sems on the suit, the suit has 5 fingers so the preformer can use there heands.
                    In the suit there is the digatal form of Willam.V.Afton. Springbonnie is litery his personal evitar, this is how Willam sees himself.
                    All though FredBear started every thing SpringBonnie is Willams, he has an attachment to this suit. FredBear and SpringBonnie would preform for small but inthusiestic children crouds. Finelly dilivering fentasy and fun for all the kids lighing and inspirening them  the same exsect way he was delited and inspierd so many years a go.
                    This could of been Willams ending in the story if would of been perfect, if it wasnt for one thing enter Chica's party world.A rivil restoran with singing animals his idea exept they did it better, Willam might of been the first but he want the best he was hirt the prid full Willam Afton to addmit it but this restorant was abil to do the thing he all ways wanted to do make the animals exwaly come to lif.
                    All of the preformesrs are animatronics, mattile andoskelliton powerd by buttris [not any normal buttry but car buttrys] they can freely talk, sing and move with out any humans in them it was like magic, magic cpming from a brilant creator calld Henry Emily.
                    This Henry in some small way harnest the power of life it self Afton admierd him jealous of him also looked apon this man with awh.
                    Chica's party world was a small cabirley with a elefant magician and a hippo with rebiles on and on that one was more like a joke to the perints. The main stage was ment for the kids show a yellow Chikan [witherd chika was on stage first watch the video for more info] with the name Chica, along siad her a band of contry animals including a pig named PigPech,up beet frog named Happy frog and a brown bear named Nedd [Henry was not really creatiive with the names] .
                    But bears where Aftons thing, adding insolt to injery they named the Bear NeddBear he is a derect copy of FredBear. [ side note if would like to know more abot the character highly recomand to get the fnaf offichal character encyclopedia it's licked below also in other pages] . Aftons jealouse got the best if him  it turnd to bitterness for the rivle pizzary where peapole where choosing  over FredBears.
                    Evenchuwaly Willam's rstorant when in benkrapsy, only for Henry to baile Willam out of bankrupsy a nother insolt a nither humanleshion that Willam woulden't forget.
